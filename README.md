# Speedrun Race Dashboard
A quick solution to displaying and managing Twitch streams for Speedrun races/marathons.

### About
This was previously made for Halo Speedrunning marathons but was replaced by a better, more complex system. I have released this with as little "bloat" as possible, to just focus on the core feature of getting streams to display in a nice layout.

### Usage
It is as simple as setting up a browser scene in OBS that points to the localhost address that the homepage gives you. It is designed for 1920x1080
